## Description
React-based portfolio showcasing my web development projects. Features include an About Me section, project portfolio, contact form, and downloadable resume. Built with React, styled for a polished, mobile-first design, and deployed on Netlify.

## User Story and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
